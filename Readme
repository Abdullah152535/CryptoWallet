This is a Simple Crypto Wallet App Which Displays the Latest prices and Percentage changes in them 
Also There is a portfolio section which can show the holdings of the user on the screen . Since there is no Blockchain Linked 
We can't add a transfer or withdraw feature
For Portfolio  we can use dummy data but it is not used currently

There are Login Sign Up screens from where we move to main Screens

Then there is bottom Tab Navigation which provides navigation Between main Screens which are Home, Portfolio, Trade and Market Screen

Home screen Displays the Balance Info of User 
ALso data for Top crypto Currencies 

The data of crypto Currencies is fetched From Coin Gecko API
THe API is hit only once inside the provider component of Context API THen every screen consumes that context So we don't need to Hit API
on every screen Separately
Also We used Victory Native Library for Portraying price change of crypto currency in form of chart

The chart is not animated because the Library which we originaly intended to use gave some dependency clashes ( React native reanimated and React Navigationn) These
two libraries were using different versions of same Library internally ( React-native-gesture-handler) which caused some Clashed. I wasted 5 days on trying to resolve the clash but failed so instead I used simple chart Library

We display Crypto currencies in a flatlist, whenever some item is clicked the chart of that crypto currency is displayed 

FOr trade screen I added a Modal over the bottom Tab bar which is displayed over whichever screen we were on. The Modal closes on clicking any button
